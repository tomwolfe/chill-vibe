# chill-vibe 🎧

**chill-vibe** is a CLI orchestration layer for autonomous coding agents that optimizes *reliability, determinism, and recovery* rather than raw model intelligence.

It implements a **Reasoning → Mission → Verification → Recovery** control loop that consistently outperforms direct agent invocation on complex, multi-file codebases—without requiring larger models, IDE lock-in, or human babysitting.

chill-vibe’s advantage is architectural: it makes autonomous coding **harder to fail**.

## 🚀 What Makes chill-vibe Different

Most coding agents rely on:

* implicit success (“this looks done”),
* blind retries,
* model self-assessment,
* and human intervention.

**chill-vibe replaces those failure points with explicit structure:**

* **Machine-verifiable success criteria** (not vibes)
* **Automatic State Rollback** (never start recovery from a corrupted state)
* **Second-pass mission validation** (expert auditor pass)
* **Structured JSON mission contracts** (zero ambiguity)
* **Failure classification + memory-aware recovery**
* **Deterministic behavior across different models**

This shifts performance from *peak brilliance* to *variance compression*—the dominant failure mode of autonomous agents today.

## 🧠 The Architecture

chill-vibe operates as a four-stage control loop:

### Phase A: Context Extraction (The "Eyes")

Uses `git-dump` to aggregate the entire repository into a single, LLM-friendly context file (default: `codebase_context.txt`).

This guarantees full architectural visibility and eliminates partial-context reasoning errors.

---

### Phase B: Strategic Reasoning (The "Brain")

Uses Gemini (default: `gemini-3-flash-preview`) exclusively for *planning*, not execution.

1. **Strategic Analysis**: Analyzes the codebase and user constraints to define a path forward.
2. **Mission Synthesis**: Generates a **structured JSON mission contract** containing:
   * Explicit objectives & Non-goals
   * Forbidden actions
   * Ordered execution checklist
   * **Machine-verifiable success criteria** (commands, file checks, invariants)
3. **Second-Pass Validation**: An "Expert Mission Auditor" pass reviews the contract for completeness, testability, and safety before execution.

This step intentionally reduces prompt entropy and removes open-ended interpretation.

---

### Phase C: Autonomous Execution (The "Muscle")

Launches a coding agent (`gemini-cli`, `qwen`, `aider`, etc.) as a subprocess.

* The agent receives a self-contained, checklist-driven mission.
* Pre-execution file baselines are captured for invariant checking.
* The agent is treated as a precision executor.

---

### Phase D: Verification & Recovery (The Control Loop)

After execution:

1. **Success Verification**: Criteria are run automatically and results are normalized into structured, machine-readable forms. Supports:
   * `pytest` & `ruff`: Semantic and linting checks.
   * `coverage: <min_percent>`: Enforces minimum test coverage.
   * `eval: <python_snippet>`: Custom state verification via Python one-liners.
   * `no_new_files`: Invariant enforcement.
   * `exists: <path>`: File/directory existence.
   * `contains: <path> <regex>`: Content validation.
2. **Automatic State Rollback**: If verification fails and `--rollback` is enabled, the system automatically performs a `git reset --hard` to the pre-execution HEAD. This ensures the next recovery attempt starts from a clean slate rather than a "half-baked" or broken state.
3. **Change Summarization**: Generates a human-readable summary of all filesystem changes using `git diff`.
4. **Classification & Memory**: If checks fail, the failure is classified (LOGIC, TOOLING, etc.). The recovery engine generates a **"Lessons Learned"** summary that contrasts what was attempted against the specific verification failures.
5. **Targeted Bounded Recovery**: A recovery strategy is generated, incorporating **historical failure memory** and the detailed verification results. The loop is explicitly bounded to prevent unproductive retries or repeated failure modes.

This loop converts retries from blind restarts into informed adaptation.

## 📊 Competitive Positioning

| System         | Success Detection      | Recovery Quality          | Determinism | Model Lock-in | Expected Task Reliability |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | Human judgment         | Manual                    | Low–Medium  | Yes           | High, high variance       |
| Codex Agent    | Partial (tests)        | Blind retry               | Medium      | Yes           | High, brittle             |
| Cursor Agent   | Implicit               | Manual                    | Low         | Yes           | Medium–High               |
| Devin          | Scripted               | Weak                      | Medium      | Yes           | Medium                    |
| **chill-vibe** | **Machine-verifiable** | **Targeted control loop** | **High**    | **No**        | **High, low variance**    |

chill-vibe does not replace better models—it **multiplies their reliability**.

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url> chill-vibe
cd chill-vibe
pip install .
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-google-api-key'
```

---

## 📖 Usage

```bash
chill-vibe [path_to_repo] [options]
```

### Key Options

* `--agent` – Execution agent (`gemini-cli`, `aider`, `qwen`, `mentat`, `gpt-me`)
* `--thinking` – Reasoning depth for planning (`HIGH` default)
* `--model` – Gemini model for planning
* `--dry-run` – Generate mission without executing
* `--retry` – Enable structured recovery loop
* `--rollback` – Enable automatic git rollback on verification failure
* `--history` – View mission logs
* `--doctor` – Environment diagnostics

---

## 📝 Mission Logging

All missions are logged to `.chillvibe_logs.jsonl`, including:

* generated mission contracts
* success criteria
* failure classifications
* recovery strategies

This enables auditability, debugging, and reproducibility—features absent in most agent workflows.

---

## 💡 When to Use chill-vibe

Best suited for:

* Medium-to-large repositories
* Cross-cutting architectural changes
* Poorly documented codebases
* Long-running autonomous tasks

Not optimized for:

* Single-file edits
* Trivial changes
* Interactive pair-programming

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Autonomous coding doesn’t fail because models are weak.

It fails because **success is implicit, retries are blind, and responsibility is fuzzy**.

chill-vibe fixes that—by turning autonomous coding into a control system instead of a guessing game.
